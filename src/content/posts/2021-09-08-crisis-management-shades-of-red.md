This is an unplanned piece from many years ago that I brought back because of the symbolic relevance it has. It's the idea that help is right around the corner and is looking to pick people up- but at the same time there is the sacrifice of those who pull the front, almost 'the front of the effort'. The characters the the front of the image are meant to be chicken nuggets- and they are pulling the chicken as some added irony.
