The image is a play on the master work by Pablo Picasso. The imagery though- seeks to address something very different. Among the musicians is a beggar and in close proximity is a pig which laughs without hesitation. This is a commentary on conditions of the workers- as performers. And a reflection on those who do not have the ability to get up and play to the crowd.
