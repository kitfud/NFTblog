This is a loaded image which was created before the pandemic period. It's coincidence that there is a bat behind the lens of the camera- which evokes the idea that the animal is the conductor for some performative act. The foot coming over the character in the center speaks to the overbearing weight of existing in a capitalist society where many workers have to 'perform' in a fast pace, just to eat. There is tension and conflict  I seek to elicit from the viewer.
