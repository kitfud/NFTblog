I love renaissance art and the themes chosen for artist's during this period's work. The symbolism within a "Madonna and Child" painting is timeless- the intention in this rendition is to challenge conceptions of identity and values while still providing symbols of hope; the encouragement of re-birth and a nod to better times.
