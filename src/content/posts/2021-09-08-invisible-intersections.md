This is the capstone piece for the collection, After The Storm, 2021. It is a very personal piece too which speaks to the many ways in which identity intersect and how this changes our view of the world. We must never forget this about other people as well- in the end I do believe that the diversity of ideas and people is what will 'remedy' the pains of our time.
