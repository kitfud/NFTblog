No- this is not an anti mask piece. It's the opposite. It's a commentary on the thrill of those periods past when we have felt 'Out of the Storm', able to navigate the world maskless vs. the contrast when needed. Bingo! as a word was picked to show a sense of surprise- as it has felt strange to bounce back and forth between the public health guidance and the 'social contract' we make as citizens.
