Originally titled "Broken" this piece was named "Build Back Better" to evoke a sense of helplessness in face of overwhelming odds. While the slogan on the surface is encouraging, so often the feeling has been one of not knowing what to build upon or who to reach to for help. The feeling of heartbreak is what I what I want to communicate.
