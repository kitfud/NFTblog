Thank you so much for viewing my art. It is an intimate facet of my past and I hope to provoke ideas and reflection for the viewer.

When I first started producing digital art it was with the most simple of digital drawing tools. These outlets provided a means for me to showcase my feelings and emotions through spontaneous and unplanned drawing sessions. 10+ years on upon learning how to use more advanced drawing software- I realized the possibility of reinterpreting some of the old drawings made many years ago. 

Today, the transition to appropriating my artwork as NFTs represents a new venture- one I hope will bring more visibility to some of the issues and ideas I attempt to raise with my art and the modern interpretation for the 2021, American - context. 

In the end, I am an optimist and I know that out of the severe storms come beauty. If we can't look forward and learn during hard times, then we stagnate. It's with love and a feeling of seizing the moment that I have produced this collection of images for you. 

Thank you again.
