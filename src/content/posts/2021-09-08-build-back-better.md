Originally titled "Broken" this piece was named "Build Back Better" to evoke a sense of helplessness in face of overwhelming odds. While the slogan on the surface is encouraging, so often the feeling has been one of not knowing what to build upon or who to reach for for help. The piece also speaks to a reliance on our neighbors/'saviors' who also walk the fine line between breaking the remaining filaments of hope through the reality of what they are 'sitting' upon as well.
