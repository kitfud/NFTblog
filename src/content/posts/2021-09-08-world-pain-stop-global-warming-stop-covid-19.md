This image brings to mind lots of suffering on my part. There is a divine aspect to this suffering which I am trying to convey- behind the hair of a figure hurling the world, and the problems that come with it, right at the viewer. It is my opinion that destiny plays a part in any challenge- the the problems ignored, and time running out- the sense that more challenges await is inevitable.
