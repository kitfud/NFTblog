This is one of the first images I drew and was completely unplanned. When I first introspected on the imagery- it reminded me of a nightmare. But then again, a nightmare with some characters resembling bulls- When I think of a bull run I think of of the excitement of being at the front of the a herd- a certain lunacy in putting oneself in that position, maybe for enjoyment or maybe just to wear the bulls out.
