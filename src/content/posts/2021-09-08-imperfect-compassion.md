Artists of the past, Michelangelo being one, have chosen to craft works of devotion via the theme of pieta. This image is similar though it does not even come close to realizing the idealized forms as those posited by great renaissance artists. Moreover, during the time this image was created as a time of personal shortcoming for the artist. The intention with the reinterpreted image is to speak to conceptions of identity, idealization as well as linguistic symbolism which surrounds us. The stark contrast falls short while still offering something of beauty- the idea of rebirth through juxtaposing forms.
