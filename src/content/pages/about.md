Thank you so much for viewing my art. It is a persona facet of my past and I hope to provoke ideas and reflection for the viewer.

When I first started producing digital art it was with the most simple of digital drawing tools. These provided an outlet for me to showcase my feelings and emotions. Upon learning how to use the software, Illustrator, was when I realized the possibility of reinterpreting some of the old drawings I had made many years ago. Today, the transition into appropriating my work as NFTs represents a transformation and a new venture- and one I hope will bring more visibility to some of the issues and ideas I seek to raise with my art. 

In the end, I am an optimist and I know that out of the most severe storms can come beauty. If we can't look forward and learn during hard times, then we are stagnating. It's with love and a feeling of seizing the moment that I have produced this collection of images for you. 

Thank you for your time.
