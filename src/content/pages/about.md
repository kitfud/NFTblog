Thank you so much for viewing my art. It is an intimate part of my past and I hope to provoke ideas and reflection for the viewer.

When I first started producing digital art it was with the most simple of digital drawing tools. These outlets provided a means for me to showcase my feelings and emotions through spontaneous and unplanned drawing sessions. 10+ years on I've realized the possibility of reinterpreting some of the digital drawings I made many years ago- to learn from them, and to tell a story. 

Today, the transition to appropriating my artwork into NFTs represents a venture- one I hope will bring more visibility to some of the issues and ideas I attempt to raise as well as document the 2021 context. 

NFT listings are on OpenSea and can be found: [HERE](https://opensea.io/collection/after-the-storm-2021).  

In the end, I am an optimist and I know that out of the severe storms come beauty. If we can't look forward and learn during hard times, then we stagnate. It's with love and a feeling of seizing the moment that I have produced this collection. 

Thank you again.
