The idea with this image is to offer some advice and tranquility through the colors. The intention was to express that the first step in leadership is to heal ourselves- during the tough COVID period where we all have had limited mobility. What some of us can control is our ability to look inwards during our solitude. The image proposes that a first step in being a leader is to acknowledge wounds rather than hide them.
