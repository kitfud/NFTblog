This image brings to mind lots of suffering on my part. There is a divine aspect to suffering which I am trying to convey- behind the hair of a figure hurling the world at the viewer. It is my opinion that destiny plays a part in any challenge- with the problems ignored, and time running out- a sense that more challenges await is inevitable- unless there is a change, of course.
