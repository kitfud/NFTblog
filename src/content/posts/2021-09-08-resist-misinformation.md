Strange times we live in where fake news floats about just as regularly as 'the real thing.' More surprising is the extent to which large groups of people have gone into believing and aligning themselves with questionable moral stances.

This piece is meant to serve as encouragement to sort through the non-sense rhetoric seeping from dark places in the quest for self realization in the hope of stabler times.
