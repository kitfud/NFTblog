No- this is not an anti mask piece. It's the opposite. It's a commentary on the thrill of those periods past when we have felt 'out of the storm'; able to navigate the world maskless vs. the contrast when needed. Bingo, as a word, was picked to show a sense of surprise- It has felt strange to bounce back and forth between the public health guidance and the 'social contract' we make as citizens. Maybe this is a nod to more carefree times.
